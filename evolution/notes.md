# EEB 122 - Evolution, Ecology and Behavior 

## Lecture 1 - The Nature of Evolution

  * When gene variation is highly correlated to reproductive success, natural
    selection is taking place. Otherwise the genes are simply experiencing
    genetic drift.
  * Focal errors increase as aperture size increases (a small aperture allows
    for full focus without adjusting for focal length) => organisms with smaller
    eyes don't need a focus mechanism :)
  * The central dogma states that genotype effects phenotype, there is no
    mechanism for the reverse. What if phenotype could effect genotype? How
    would that effect evolution?

## Lecture 2 - Basic Transmission Genetics

  * The whole genome has been duplicated twice in evolutionary history. Genome
    duplication allows for innovation while preserving basic functionality.
    Large duplications can be correlated with explosions of diversity.

## Lecture 3 - Adaptive Evolution: Natural Selection

  * Evolution doesn't only produce things that work well, evolution can be
    (adaptive, neutral, maladaptive)
  * J.B.S Haldane
  * The peacock was trading off survival for mating success. He was a victim of
    female preferences :)

## Lecture 4 - Neutral Evolution: Genetic Drift

  * DNA not leading to increased fitness is eventually eroded by neutral
    mutation
  * Most large mammalian genomes are littered with the fossil genomes of
    viruses. These viruses spliced their genomes into non transcribed portions
    of the host genome and failed to reproduce.
  * Organisms can increase their mutation rates under stressful conditions by
    down-regulating their DNA repair mechanisms
  * "The process of mutation produces a lot of variation and then natural
    selection edits it"
  * meiotic drivers are cool! little bandits that promoted their own expression
    by poisoning all cells in a larger region and only providing an antitode to
    those with the right genes
  * Cheetahs went through a population bottleneck in the last few thousand years
    which caused the variability of their immune system alleles to diminish to
    such an extent that a skin graft from any cheetah to any other cheetah in
    the world will take.
  * Population size has no effect on fixation rate of neutral alleles. The
    larger the population, the more mutations, but the probability of fixation
    of any random mutation is proportionally lower. (Fixation takes longer in
    larger populations because the probability of fixation is 1/N where N is the
    size of the population. Every offspring has only a << 100% chance of passing
    on the mutation so most mutations die out.)

## Lecture 5 - Quantitative Genetics

  * Evolution of sexual diploids follows a slow-fast-slow pattern. Recessive
    genes hiding in heterozygous carriers are very difficult to weed out of a
    population.

## Lecture 6 - Genetic Variation

  * Genes that control mutation rates evolve much easier in asexual organisms
    since recombination in sexual organisms potentially decouples these genes
    from the genes they are trying to control.
  * Mutation rates in DNA vs RNA (10^-9 vs 10^-5). Orders of magnitude lower in
    DNA. 10^-3 is the optimal rate reached by most prokaryotes.
  * The impact of recombination on the genetic diversity of the population would
    allow humanity to evolve for about 1000 more generations until we run out of
    advantageous variation.
  * Nash equillibria in Genetics are the reason Male/Female populations are
    usually split 50/50
  * Earth has only been around for long enough to produce a very tiny phenotype
    space (our genotypes code for enormous possibilites)

## Lecture 7 - Development

  * Hydroxyapetide (building block of bones) strengthens itself in the direction
    of applied stress
  * Think of the control region of a gene as the keys on a piano, the fingers as
    the transcription factors, evolution as the composer who wrote the score :)
  * Chemical concentration gradients determine positional information of the
    organism (front vs back) and create the initial differences in transcription
    factors.
  * BOXes are highly conserved segments of DNA which code for transcription
    factors
  * HOX(Homeobox) genes are so deeply preserved that HOX1 is the same in humans,
    flatworms, etc
  * MADS for flowers
  * Changing development is like remodeling a car while driving it. Hard to do
    without making things fall apart. Enormous constraints exist.
  * Genes don't cause development by themselves. They are steering the dynamics
    of gene products which interact with environmental inputs. In other words,
    development maps the information in genotypes into material of phenotypes as
    a function of the environment encountered.
  * Does evolution mainly take place through creation of new functional proteins
    or through advancement of gene control mechanisms using existing tools?

## Lecture 8 - The Expression of Variation: Reaction Norms

  * Describes the set of phenotypes into which a genotype can be mapped as a
    function of the environment
  * Ancient developmental genes set up a relatively rigid framework within which
    plasticity is expressed

## Lecture 9 - Evolution of Sex

  * reproduction <> recombination (asex vs sex)
  * Sex -> recombination
  * Sexual reproduction is advantageous to asexual due to clonal interference.
    When multiple advantageous mutations appear simultaneously they can be
    combined easily through sex to produce an optimal form, while in asexual
    organisms only one mutation can dominate the population at any time,
    combinatory mutations can only happen in order. First the most advantageous
    mutation is assimilated, then the second most, then the third, until the
    optimal form is achieved.
  * Costs of sex: genome dilution, time consuming (Ex. sexual reproduction in
    yeast takes 8hr, asexual takes 1hr), risk of predation in the process of
    mating (predators, stds, etc)
  * What forces maintain recombination? Genetic: recombinational repair isolates
    and throws away mutations in a genome. Finite asexual populations are
    deleteriously affected by drift because the number of mutations accumulates
    through the populations.
  * The Red Queen Hypothesis: In a coevolutionary arms race, you have to run as
    fast as you can just to stay in place.
  * Why did anisogomy (different gametes egg vs sperm) evolve? Avoid organelle
    conflicts, allows for frequency selective evolution (If a part of the
    population is competing to make bigger eggs to protect the offspring, then
    the other part can be just as successful evolving faster sperm to inseminate
    more eggs)
  * Sex WINS! in any population where competition is abundant and evolution must
    be efficient.
  * Asexuality only works when the whole developmental sequence can be carried
    out only by genes from one parent. NOT IN HUMANS
  * Asexuality has large costs in the long run. Asexual types are driven to
    extiction faster than sex organisms.
  * How have ancient asexuals survived?

## Lecture 10 - Evolutionary Conflict

  * Two level conflict -> When there is an advantage in replication at the lower
    level which eventually leads to a disadvantage in survival of the organism.
    (Cancer, mitochondrial mutations, etc) One selection process contained
    inside another.
  * long poison/short antidote approach of plasmids directly affects the
    survival of the cell containing the plasmid and helps the plasmid spread.
    The plasmid codes for a long range poison which kill all nearby cells which
    don't have the gene and a short range antidote which protects an infected
    cell.
  * Biparental inheritance of cytoplasmic genomes (organnelles) would create
    conflict expressed as organelle cancers.
  * Mother/Father conflict: The father's success depends on successfull mating
    while the mother's success depends on the number of offspring she can bear.
    This creates an assymetry.
  * Genes can be "imprinted" or methylated which turns them off. Imprinting
    during gamete production stops genes from being expressed in the embryo.
    This way one sec can "extract" more from the other by turning off its own
    gene alleles and allowing the partner's versions to take over. (Birth Weight
    is a good example. The father turns off his growth down regulation genes to
    make the embryo larger while the mother turns off her growth up regulation
    genes to make it smaller).
  * These conflicts are usually in careful balance, large deviations cause harm
    to both sides.
  * How to reduce genomic conflict: make interests symmetric by making
    transmission vertical (so the offsprings survival depends on the hosts
    survival), make individual success depend on group survival (monogomy
  * Think of organisms as a heirarchy of replication levels. Selection can occur
    at any of these levels.
  * Sexual organisms experience much more genomic conflict than asexual ones.

## Lecture 11 - Life History Evolution

  * There is enormous variety in life history evolution across the tree of life.
    Life history evolution attempts to explain the design of phenotypes for
    reproduction success.
  * 4 General assumptions help predict age and size at maturity.
      1. Older first time parents have higher quality offspring
      2. Older first time parents can have more offspring (they're bigger)
      3. These advantages of delaying maturity are counterbalanced by the
         advantages of shorter generation time
      4. In an evolutionary equilibrium these advantages and disadvantages will
         be balanced
  * Age and size at maturity has a reaction norm. Growth rates vary, etc
  * Optimal clutch size is usually an intermediate value. Its a tradeoff between
    the number of babies born at one time with the fitness of the babies or the
    ability of the parent to later give birth to more babies. Large clutches
    cause weak babies or overworked parents.
  * Selection pressures which lengthen life decrease the relative contribution
    to fitness of offspring and increase that of adults. In contrast if adult
    mortality rates increase then organisms should evolve more rapid aging. Why
    invest in maintaining a body that will be dead anyway for other reasons?
  * Death at old age makes little difference in fitness. Assuming an animal is
    immortal, has 80% chance of survival a day, and gives birth to 10 offspring
    daily, the expected number of offspring in its lifetime is 10(1 + 0.8 +
    0.64...) = 50. A genetic tradeoff which would allow the animal to give birth
    to 11 offspring on the first day but will take away its immortality has an
    expected number of offspring = 50.3, a 0.6% increase in fitness. Evolution
    will select the non-immortal species.
  * US Stats: From the age of 46 evolution no longer cares if you're here
    anymore, from the point of view of children.
  * Aging is a byproduct of selection for reproductive performance. It arises
    through the accumulation of many genes that have positive effects early in
    life and negative effects later in life.
  * Aging proves that a gene centered view of evolution is empirically correct.

## Lecture 12 - Sex Allocation
## Lecture 13 - Sexual Selection

  * The more polygamous the species, the greater the difference in male/female
    lifespans. (Shorter male lifespan)
  * Secondary sexual characteristics incur costs, thus they only appear after
    maturation
  * Sex with greater reproductive potential competes, sex with lesser
    reproductive potential chooses. Generally males compete, females choose.
  * Female choice is determined by good genes, sexy sons, and sensory bias
    hypotheses

## Lecture 14 - Speciation

  * Cryptic species can arise when strong selection exists for physical
    appearance. DNA and protein divergence can occur while the end structures of
    the organism's physiology remains the same.
  * Species isolation is mediated by three main processes Prezygotic (mating
    behavior, gamete release), Insemination (gamete recognition), Postzygotic
    (viability, fertility)

## Lecture 15 - Phylogenetics

  * Looks can be deceiving. Many similar looking species belong to polyphyletic
    (different ancestry) groups.

## Lecture 16 - Comparative Methods

  * The longer the life expectancy, the more important is the species' mate
    fidelity. Advantages of fidelity accumulate with longer life spans.
  * Based on minimum population size necessary to maintain transpecific
    polymorphisms (against drift), mitochondrial Eve must have lived in a
    population of at least 10,000 (based on MHC polymorphisms)

## Lecture 17 - Key Events in the History of Life

  * What is Life? Multiplication, variation, heredity, and metabolism Metabolism
    - using free energy to keep a partially isolated system in an ordered state
      against an entropy gradient. Take in energy, excrete entropy :)
  * Natural selection can only take over once reproduction, variation in
    reproductive success and inheritance exist. How do you boot strap these
    processes?
  * The problem with kick starting inheritance: the amount of information that
    can be maintained by selection is limited by copying fidelity.
  * Smaller gnomes can support higher mutation rates without being affected
  * Eigen's Paradox: With non-enzymatic replication, the maximum genome size is
    100 nucleotides... 1000-10000 nucleotides required for enzymes. Catch 22!
    Solution? Hypercycles: multiple small genomes cooperating for substrate
    through I/O in semi isolated system.
  * Membranes automatically divide once they're big enough to be destabilized by
    currents. A perfect vessel for self replicating isolated systems...
  * Eukaryotes are basically more sophisticated prokaryotes, with better
    compartmentalization, parallel dna replication, tools for managing osmotic
    pressure (no need for cell wall, cytoskeleton instead)
  * Origin of chromosomes: if it takes the interaction of 2 or more genes to
    produce an organism, linking them will guarantee that they will appear in
    all offspring. This is balanced by the time cost of replicating many genes
    in series instead of parallel. It also eliminates competition between genes.
    Linking them will sync their replication cycles, preserving product ratio
    balance.
  * Transfering the genome of symbiotic organelle into the eukaryotic nucleous
    increases efficiency, reduces organelle variety (prevents mitochondrial
    cancers and organelle competition).

### Summary
  1. The hierarchy grows: additional selection at a new level of replication
  2. Functional specialization
  3. Changes in information transmission system
  4. Selection for cooperation resolves conflicts between hierarchy layers

## Lecture 18 - Major Events in the Geological Theater

  * The Black Sea got it's name from the fact that it's anoxic (no oxygen/no
    life) below a depth of 100 feet. Anoxic seas arise from volcanic eruptions
    (large volume methane release). The methane reacts with the oxygen to form
    CO2.

## Lecture 19 - Fossil Record

  * Mass extinctions may open up space for the radiation of surviving groups

  * There are fossil records of long stasis periods. Why would these happen if
    mutation can't be stopped?  The externalist explanation: The larvae find the
    environment where the adults will develop, thus reducing the need for
    adaptation in later stages of life.  Internalist ex:
      1. Tradeoffs create a stabilizing selection.
      2. Fixation of key traits lead to embedding. Can't change key traits
         without destroying development.

  * Cope's law: Things get bigger
      1. The upper limit on size is far away while the lower limit is nearby,
         therefore random change will eventually lead to production of larger
         organism through diffusion of the gene space.
      2. Coevolutionary arms race between predator and prey.

## Lecture 20 - Co-Evolution

  * A change in one gene stimulates change in a gene of another species and vice
    versa

  * Because of high frequency interactions between functional units in the cell
    and the high cost of errors due to accumulation, form matches function very
    closely as a result of co adaptation between the different structures

  * The integration of an organism is achieved by the coadaptation of it's parts 

  * Principles determining levels of co-adaptation
    1. Frequency of interaction
    2. Impact on reproductive success
    3. Relative evolutionary potential
    4. The Red Queen - open ended struggle that results with no long term
       reduction in extinction probability

  * Interactions that favor specializations
    1. Parasite-host
    2. Predator-prey
    3. Mutualism

  * Leigh Van Valen's Claim:
    All species on earth are caught in a coevolutionary web. Over a long stretch
    of time no one species gets a leg up on probability of survival. This is
    supported by the fact that the long term extinction rate has stayed constant.

## Lecture 21 - Evolutionary Medicine
            
### Resources
  * yale.edu/evomedsymposia/
  * Book: Evolution in Health and Disease
  * Talk: Sebastian Bonhoeffer on HIV

### Thrifty Phenotypes
  * Research shows that nutritionally stressed infants have increased risk of
    obesity.
  * Stress early in life switches the developing individual to a physiology
    effective at conserving energy but inappropriate for adequate food.
  * Historical famines support the research. Also reproduced in rats and sheep.

### The Hygiene/Old Friends Hypothesis
  * Our immune systems evolved with worms and bacteria in our bodies
  * In recent years, antibiotics and other medical innovations are lowering the
    occurence of infectios disease although automimmune disease is exploding
  * ex. Type 1 diabetes... Infectios agents are antagonists of Type 1 diabetes
    in model mice.
  * Various nematode infections downregulate immune inflamatory response.
    Because many parasites strive to be undetected in the infected organism and
    tend to reside in the host for many years in order to guarantee reproduction
    success, host organisms evolved a way to downregulate their immune system in
    response to these infections and effectively ignore them.Removing the
    infectious agents causes the host to upregulate the immune system and
    potentially overreact to simple infections.
  * Therapy with parasitic worms has led to significant improvements for people
    with various autoimmune diseases.
    
  * Humans evolve more slowly than their cultures, therefore they are mismatched
    to modern life. Mismatches to both diet and hygiene have led to serious
    medical problems.
  * There is 10^17 bacteria (a ton) per one acre of farm land. Thats alot of
    information storage. Drug resistance evolves in the soil and in wild animals.
  * Drug resistance does not necesiarrily evolve in response to modern medicine.
    All the genes responsible for making bacteria drug resistance have been in
    nature for thousands of years. Widespread agricultural use of bacteria may be
    the main cause of drug resistant bacteria.

### Virulence evolution passes through 3 phases
  1. first contact of a disease agent with a new host, as with accidental
     infections. Ex. Ebola, bird flu, S.A.R.S.
  2. the parasite has just established itself in a new host species and is far
     from the optimal virulence. Ex. HIV, myxoma virus
  3. the parasite is established in a host species and evolves in response to
     changes in the virulence optimum. Ex. Tuberculosis, Malaria, 

  * Virulence/Transmission Tradeoff: Killing a host too fast is counterproductive
    since the virus doesn't get a chance to spread. Many Phase 1 viruses exhibit
    this behavior. Virulence is usually driven to an intermediate level.
  * Evolutionary techniques are used to make viruses harmless to humans yet
    preserve their immune signature. By subjecting the virus to different
    environmental replications conditions (new host, petri dish) the virus becomes
    very efficient at reproducing in the new environment but looses efficacy to
    reproduce in the original host (sometimes completely). These 'modified'
    viruses can then be used as vacines. A jack of all trades is a master of none.

## Lecture 22 - Evolutionary Transition Between Individual and Group

  * Are we stuck in a major evolutionary transition between individual and group
    interest?
  * The susceptibility to moral emotions is innate, those lacking them are
    psychopaths.

### Hallmarks of Major Transitions
  * Independent units loose their independence and fuse into a larger whole.
  * Units specialize on different function, achieving division of labor.
  * The division of labor integrates the new unit and improves performance in
    competition with like units.
  * Inter-group conflict is suppressed to achieve more cohesive integration.
  * Often a system of information transmission emerges.

Examples:
  Prokareotes -> Eukaryotes
  Single Cell Eukaryotes -> Multicellular Organisms
  Multicellular Organisms -> Family Groups
  Family Groups -> Incect Societies
  Family Groups (Human) -> Cultural Societies (Language)

  * Individual fitness is often strikingly in conflict with the social cohesion
    needed for group performance.  How can this conflict be resolved?

  * Convert separate stakes to common stakes
  * Impose ecological constraint
    - If its risky not to be in a group, then one will overlook the difficulty of group membership.
  * Cooperate with and sacrifice for kin
  * Punish defectors
  * Stabilize the division of labor
  * Promote reciprocity

  * So where do social emotions come from?
    - Deference to leaders
    - Guilt
    - Embarrassment and shame
    - Outrage at defection
    - Desire for revenge
    - Impulse to conform
      
  * Genes use hormones to create emotions that manipulate our phenotypes. Those
    emotions become the biological handles on which culture pulls. Our minds are
    not blank slates. Some of our programming is for social interactions.

## Lecture 23 - Logic of Science

## Lecture 24 - Climate and Distribution of Life on Earth

## Lecture 25 - Endotherms and Ectotherms

  * Hibernation is a condition where an animal will drop it's body temp very low
    during the winter to survive without much food. Only intermediate sized
    animals can hibernate due to the limitations of heat exchange mechanisms. In a
    tiny animal whose surface area to volume ratio is large, the body isn't able
    to provide enough heat to maintain an above freezing temp, while a large
    animal can't cool itself fast enough.

  * Plants create suction via transpiration pull caused by the evaporation of
    water in their leaves and a very strong xylem to avoid cavitation.

## Lecture 26 - Population Growth

  * Population growth rate = birth rate - death rate
  * Population doubling time = 69/growth rate
  * Natural selection is the key evolutionary consequence of intra specific
    competition.

##Lecture 27 - Interspecific Competition

  * Competitive Exclusion Principle: Two scpecies with very similar resource
    needs and physiology cannot coexist at equilibrium. (Two species cannot
    occupy exactly the same niche)
  * Plants use an early warning system to detect shading. When the wavelength of
    light shifts towards the red spectrum for any part of the plant, a hormone
    is released signaling growth in a different direction.

## Lecture 28 - Ecological Communities (Biodiversity)

  * Why are there so many kinds of plants and animals?
    - Because evolution has packed them tightly into the available niches.
    - There should therefore be a limit to the similarity of competing species.
    - Species differ more when they live together than when they live apart
      because competition can drive all but one similar species to extinction.
  * Top-Down Control
    - Predation may allow competitively inferior species to survive by hunting
      on the superior competitor
    - Predation is maintaining biodiversity by eating dominant competitors
  * Trophic Cascades and Predation
    - Result in inverse patterns in abundance of biomass across more than one
      trophic link. Abundant top predators reduce the number of mid-level
      consumers and increase the biomass of basal producers.
    - Predators might prefer the competitively superior prey since there are
      usually more of them
  * Modern communities with similar species compositions had different sequences
    of assembly
    - Each species doesn't prepare the way for the next
    - Tree species in an eastern hardwood forest can be assembled in almost
      random order
  * The same community composition can result either from evolution of from
    assembly.
    - Assembly is the mixing of existing species
    - Speciation is the evolution of a community of modern species from a mix of
      ancesstors
  * Perspective on Assembly
    - Regional and historic forces are just as important as local determinants
      of biodiversity like competition, predation, and parasites.
    - The data analyzed should match the scale of the process considered.
  * Dispersal
    - As dispersal increases, local diversity first increases, then decreases
    - Regional diversity stays stable until local diversity hits its peak, then
      both decline.
    - Maximum diversity exists at a medium level of dispersal.

## Lecture 29 - Island Biogeography and Invasive Species
  
  * References
    * Nietzche - The Birth of Tradgedy

  * What determines biodiversity in a fragmented area?
    * Initial Theory
      - Immigration
      - Extinction
    * Size and Distance of an island affect biodiversity
      - The closer the island, the closer the biodiversity is to the main land
      - The larger the island, the more niches, the more biodiversity is allowed
    * Critique
      - Population dynamics are ignored (the theory deals with species not individuals)
      - Probabilities of immigration and extinction must differ
      - The theory doesn't allow for speciation

  * Metapopulation Theory has become more prevalent
    * Analogy: Epidemiology
      - Hosts = local patches
      - Pathogens = local populations
      - Immune response or death of host = local pathogen extinction
      - Transmission rate = migration rate
    * Transmission rate must be high enough to maintain the pathogen population
