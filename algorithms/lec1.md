3 Guiding Principles
=====================
1. Worst-case analysis
2. Constant factors don't matter
3. Assume n is large

Fast Algorithm - Running time which grows slowly with the input size.

Divide and Conquer
====================
1. Divide a problem into managable sub-problems
2. Conquer each subproblem through recursion
3. Combine solutions of sub problems into final (usually the creative step)

Apply "for free" primitive operations such as sorting to attack algorithm
problems.
